# Mean Median and Mode using Python

---

**Mean**

 The mean is the average value of all the values in a dataset. To calculate the mean value of a dataset, we first need to find the sum of all the values and then divide the sum of all the values by the total number of values. So hereâ€™s how to calculate the mean using Python

```python

    list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
    mean = sum(list1)/len(list1)
    print(mean)
```

**Median**

The Median is the middle value among all the values in sorted order. Here we need to calculate the mid-value of all the values in a dataset. But before calculating the Median, we need to arrange all the values in sorted order. There are two different ways of calculating the median value:

* when the total number of values is even: Median  = $[(n/2)th$  + ${(n/2)+1}th]/2$
* when the total number of values is odd: Median = ${(n+1)/2}$ thterm
Now below is how you can calculate the median using Python

``` Python
# Median
    list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
    list1.sort()

    if len(list1) % 2 == 0:
        m1 = list1[len(list1)//2]
        m2 = list1[len(list1)//2 - 1]
        median = (m1 + m2)/2
    else:
        median = list1[len(list1)//2]
    print(median)

```

**Mode**

Mode is the most frequently occurring value among all the values. Below is how we can calculate the mode value of a dataset using Python:

```python

    list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
    frequency = {}
    for i in list1:
        frequency.setdefault(i, 0)
        frequency[i]+=1

    frequent = max(frequency.values())
    for i, j in frequency.items():
        if j == frequent:
            mode = i
    print(mode)
```
